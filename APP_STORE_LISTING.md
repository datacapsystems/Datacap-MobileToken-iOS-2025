**Discover Secure Payment Processing with Datacap**

Datacap Token Demo showcases our enterprise-grade payment tokenization technology while serving as the official testing tool for developers and merchants. Whether you're exploring payment solutions or actively integrating Datacap's API, this app demonstrates how easy and secure payment processing can be.

**What is Payment Tokenization?**

Tokenization replaces sensitive credit card numbers with secure tokens, allowing you to process payments without storing card data. This reduces PCI compliance scope, prevents data breaches, and enables features like one-click checkout and recurring billing. See it in action with this demo app.
